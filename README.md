## Road Map (Specifics)

- Read sprites and display them to a SDL Window using SDL_Textures
- Create Ship prototype sprite (Veryveryvery basic)
- Figure out pathing inside of a sprite.
- Maybe use a Drawable interface idea for grouping all characters to be drawn?
- Create Crew Class to hold at least a Texture for the character and an id.
- Create a list of crew and use a draw method to draw them.
