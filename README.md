# AllHands

### This is repository for the group project in CSCI 345 Video Game Design @ Colorado Mesa University

All Hands will explore the idea of a fully crewed starship, rather then abstracting the idea to a handfull of crew members.
- **Manage the needs of hundreds of crew as they maintain and operate your fully operational starship.**
- **As Captain, react to events relating to your crew, your ship, and your mission.**


### Douglas Plock and Cody Grinstead   

## Road Map (Specifics)

- Read sprites and display them to a SDL Window using SDL_Textures
- Create Ship prototype sprite (Veryveryvery basic)
- Figure out pathing inside of a sprite.
- Maybe use a Drawable interface idea for grouping all characters to be drawn?
- Create Crew Class to hold at least a Texture for the character and an id.
- Create a list of crew and use a draw method to draw them.
