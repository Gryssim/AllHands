# AllHands

## This is the repository for the group project for CSCI 345, Video Game Design, @ Colorado Mesa University

All Hands will explore the idea of a fully crewed starship, rather then abstracting the idea to a handfull of crew members.

- **Manage the needs of hundreds of crew as they maintain and operate your fully operational starship.**
- **As Captain, react to events relating to your crew, your ship, and your mission.**

## Road Map (Specifics)

- ~~Read sprites and display them to a SDL Window using SDL_Textures~~
- ~~Create Ship prototype sprite (Veryveryvery basic)~~
- Tiling Engine including drawing walls on edges of rooms.
- Working Camera to explore world space.
- Event Handler class to handle user input.
- Figure out pathing for one to five Hands inside of a room/on tiles.
- Maybe use a Drawable interface idea for grouping all characters to be drawn?
- ~~Create Hand Class to hold at least a Texture for the character and an id.~~
- ~~Create a list of crew and use a draw method to draw them.~~
- Threading for pathfinding and jobs? or just hand threads?
- Crew Class for AI/decision making methods? We'll figure this out later.
- Interface Design and implementation.
